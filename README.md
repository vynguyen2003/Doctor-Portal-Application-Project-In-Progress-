# Brief Description:
The Doctor Portal Application is developed in Java using Jakarta EE APIs. This application enables doctors to efficiently manage patient appointments, track daily activities, and send messages. It provides full CRUD functionality for managing the associated database.

# Current Status:
The project is still in progress, with the Patients and Message pages under development.

# Demo Video:
New User (Registration Process):

    New users will log in with a blank profile upon registration.
    Initially, the newly created doctor account will need to add a patient under the Patients tab before being able to schedule an appointment.

Existing User:

    Existing users will have access to a pre-populated database, allowing them to easily manage and manipulate patient data and appointments.
